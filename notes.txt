a bunch of different dashbaord menus
and when you select one from the nav then we just swap out a component


for the ships component:
make the component have info in the middle, and at the bottom there is a row of icons
each icon takes you to a different menu for the ship, and there should be some kind of animation
that transitions the menu change.
